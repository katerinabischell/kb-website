### A Melioidosis Mystery

After participating in the EPA's webinar on Melioidosis and gaining insights into the dangers of toxic aromatherapy, I am eager to share my newfound knowledge. Melioidosis is caused by a contaminant; a gram-negative bacterium that is zoonotic (affects both animals and humans) and classified as a tier 1 select agent. The disease can incubate from days to years and presents symptoms such as fever, swelling, and in severe cases, death. Regions in Southeast Asia and Australia are recognized as major centers of melioidosis cases. Remarkably, in 2021, there were four cases (resulting in two deaths) in the United States that were not linked to international travel; these occurred across four different states. Genome sequencing revealed that these cases were all linked to the same strain of the bacterium. One case involved a four-year-old girl who initially exhibited symptoms of an upset stomach and fever, was unable to walk or hold up her head, and was first misdiagnosed with gastroenteritis, then a urinary tract infection. Following a brain biopsy, she was diagnosed with melioidosis. Antibody tests indicated that seven additional family members had been exposed. The source of contamination was traced to a "Better Homes and Gardens - Lavender and Chamomile Essential Oil Infusion Spray" sold by Walmart between February and October 2021. After identifying the link, Walmart issued a recall for the product and provided instructions for decontamination. Another exposure incident occurred when a pet raccoon broke a vial of the same room spray and came into contact with the liquid, leading to two weeks of acute neurological symptoms before it died three days later. The raccoon was buried in the yard, and environmental modeling suggested that the bacterium could thrive in the soil and climate conditions of Texas. The responsible company conducted targeted environmental sampling of the soil to determine the extent of contamination, evaluate the public health risk, and offer decontamination guidance. Under CERCLA (a federal law concerning pollutants and contaminants), the EPA mandated decontamination measures. The site featured mostly clay soils and was crossed by a stream with various animals present. A contingency plan was prepared regardless of whether the raccoon's carcass was found. Research pinpointed diluted bleach as the most effective treatment against the bacterium in clay soil. The effectiveness of common liquid disinfectants against non-spore-forming biological agents in soil matrices was also studied. Personal Protective Equipment for the cleanup included level C gear, full face respirators with P100 cartridges, saranex suits, and sealed wrists and ankles. The homeowners pinpointed the exact location of the burial: the CDC took 32 soil samples, three off-site controls (at 2, 4, and 6-feet radius from the carcass at the same depth), 12 tissue samples during the necropsy, and three water samples from the nearby stream. Post-sampling, one third of the soil was excavated using a mini excavator and placed into poly-lined 55-gallon drums, mixed with a 1 to 3 diluted germicide bleach solution (84 gallons total), and left to sit overnight. The treated carcass was returned to its burial site, which was then refilled with new soil. The decontaminated soil was dried and redistributed across the site. Samples were analyzed using PCR and culture attempts at the CDC: the excavated areas were filled with fresh soil and gypsum (to neutralize the bleach) and leveled. Finally, grass seed and clean straw were applied over the top.
